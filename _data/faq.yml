- question: I am a Bachelor student / I work on a different Quantum platform / etc. Is YAO suitable for me?
  answer: Excellent question. If you are a Master or PhD student in the field of Atomic, Molecular and optical physics, then surely! On the other hand, senior Bachelor students and junior Postdocs are also welcome. If you are not from the AMO Physics community in a strict sense, but you work on related topics or applications in Quantum Physics and fields such as quantum information science and technology, photonics etc. your application is also highly welcome. We made an effort this year to open up YAO to highlight cross-links to related quantum platforms and fields that share many of the concepts and technologies used in AMO physics.

# REGISTRATION
- question:  Are there any grants covering the registration fee?
  answer: Unfortunately, this time we are not able to cover the registration fee for students without funding. However, we try to keep the fees as low as possible. Nevertheless, please contact us in case you would like to participate but donâ€™t have funding from your institution. We can try to help obtain a grant in a limited number of cases.

- question: How can I complete the fee payment?
  answer: Payment must be done via bank transfer or purchase order to Fondation Jean-Marie Lehn. We will send participants the payment information via email if accepted.

# ACCOMODATION
- question: Can you book a single room for me?
  answer: Standard accommodation will be in double or triple rooms with separate beds. Single rooms are usually more expensive. If you desire a single room, we would prefer it if you book the hotel yourself or contact us so we can check with the hotel and let you know the increased fee.

# TRANSPORTATION
- question: Is local transport included in the registration fee?
  answer: Local transport during the conference is not included. However, there is a variety of tickets offered by CTS (https://www.cts-strasbourg.eu/en/online-store/fares/tickets/) and we encourage you to find the one fitting your needs and to explore the city of Strasbourg by food, bike or public transport.
