                Furthermore, if you are an experimentalist you can apply for the possibility of giving a virtual lab
                tour of your laboratory. Such a tour can include showing photos of your lab and university, showing
                brief videos or what else you deem most interesting. Important! This will not affect your chances of
                getting a talk
